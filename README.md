# University-Attendance-Management-System-

This is a term project for CMSE353 - Security of Software Systems

The objective of this system is to provide a reliable and efficient way for instructors to track student attendance in their classes. The system should allow instructors to easily record attendance for each class session, as well as view attendance data for individual students or for the class as a whole. The system should also provide tools for analyzing students and courses data, encrypting and decrypting data.
